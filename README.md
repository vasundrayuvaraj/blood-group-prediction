# blood-group-prediction via fingerprint features using deep learning


This repository is created to showcase of my work using deep learning technology

Deep learing models that I had already focused:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Netwoks (RNN)
Long short term memory (LSTM)
Gated Recurrent units (GRU)
Transformers
Generative Adversial Networks (GANs)
