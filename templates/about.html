<h1>About the Project</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study highlights the uniqueness of fingerprints in identifying individuals, which
    remains unchanged throughout life. Fingerprint evidence is highly valued in legal contexts due to
    its distinctiveness, with a low likelihood of resemblance even among identical twins. At the same
    time, knowing blood is also a crucial to everyone while they are donating blood to others or else
    to take treatment. Currently, the manual tests conducted by lab phlebotomist in laboratories can be
    time-consuming and prone to human error, which can have severe consequences, particularly in
    urgent situations or blood donations. To address these challenges, we propose a non- invasive
    method of finding blood group which uses convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN
    architecture, LeNet is used, which is a pre-trained model. During this project we committed to
    extract some features from the data, and with the help of that data, a model LeNet will be trained
    to predict blood group without taking blood sample (Non-Invasive method).

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The mostly used fingerprint application is identification of individuals using fingerprint
    patterns. Most of the organizations in India follows, fingerprint based biometric
    identification and also the gender and age identification is also considerable modality of
    the application. There are four sorts of fingerprints plans found in fingers are Loops,
    Whorls, Arches, and Mixed or Composites. The important characteristic feature fingerprint
    image may contain such as line connecting the features in different regions of image.
    Detecting blood groups using fingerprints is an innovative and non-invasive approach that
    combines biometric technology with medical information. This method leverages the
    unique patterns found in an individual's fingerprint to determine their blood type, which is
    an important piece of medical information for healthcare professionals</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>This system offers several advantages. It helps rural populations by
    determining their blood group with minimal medical resources and without the need for trained
    experts, benefiting those who fear needles. It also aids blood donation camps by efficiently
    identifying blood groups. Additionally, our system provides blood transfusion compatibility
    services and personalized nutrition recommendations based on blood group, enhancing its practical
    utility and impact.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <h3> Accuracy Concerns: </h3> The method may not achieve the same level of accuracy as traditional
blood tests, potentially leading to misclassification of blood groups. </li>
    <li> <h3>Data Variability: </h3> Fingerprint patterns can vary significantly among individuals, and
establishing a consistent correlation with blood groups might be challenging task. </li>
    <li> <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3> Developing a robust machine learning model requires extensive and
high-quality data, which can be difficult to collect and process.</li>
    <li> <h3>Cost and Accessibility of Technology:</h3> While the method aims to eliminate specialized
equipment, the initial development and deployment of the technology might be costly and require
advanced infrastructure. </li>
</ul>
